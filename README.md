With 3 years of experience as a full-stack web developer, I have successfully collaborated with cross-functional teams and stakeholders. At Modo Carshare, I develop backend services using PHP and PostgreSQL, and design responsive user interfaces with React/TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, and RESTful APIs. I also manage a legacy codebase and ensure application security in compliance with PCI standards to handle sensitive information.

At Modo, I developed a comprehensive booking management platform with features for bookings, fleet and vehicle management, accessories, profiles, and personal information. I also enhanced the user experience by working on an interactive booking map using third-party APIs.

Previously, at Wysdom.ai, I contributed to web and chatbot projects using Vue.js and React.js for the frontend, and Node.js, Python, Express, and MongoDB (NoSQL) for the backend. I am skilled in working with cloud computing providers like AWS and Azure, container solutions with Docker and Kubernetes, and using GitLab's CI/CD pipelines for deployment.

Proficient in writing feature and unit tests for both frontend and backend, I excel at troubleshooting and problem-solving, handling 85% of bug tickets at Modo—twice as many as my colleagues—and providing regular code reviews. We utilized Jira, Confluence, and GitLab for project management in an Agile environment.

My formal education includes Software Engineering degrees from Western Governors University and UBC where I learned Java for web and mobile app development, and hold certifications in project and IT service management as well as cloud foundations.
