1. LATER INTERVIEW- full stack developer

3 years of experience as a full-stack web developer working with cross-functional team members and stakeholders . At Modo Carshare, I develop backend services using PHP and PgSQL, and design responsive user interfaces with React/TypeScript, HTML5 and CSS3 and restfulAPI. I also handled legacy codebase, and ensure application security with PCI compliance because we handled sensitive customer information like credit card.

At Modo, I developed a comprehensive booking management platform with features for bookings, fleet and vehicle management, accessories, profiles, and personal information. I also worked on the interactive booking map to enhance the user experience using third party API.

Previously at Wysdom.ai, I worked on web and chatbot projects with VueJS, ReactJS for the FE and  Node.js/Python, express and MongoDB(NoSQL) for BE. I am skilled in working with cloud computing providers like AWS and Azure, container solutions with Docker and Kubenetes, and GitLab's CI/CD pipelines for deployment. 

Proficient in writing feature and unit tests for both frontend and backend I excel at troubleshooting and problem-solving, handling 85% of bug tickets at Modo—twice as many as my co-workers and gave regular code reviews. We used Jira, confluence and Gitlab for project management in an Agile environment. 

My formal education includes Software Engineering degrees from Western Governors University and UBC learned Java for web and mobile app development, with certifications in project/IT service managment and cloud foundations.
